# BookMyLuck

BookMyLuck reimagines the service booking experience by introducing an element of randomness. Instead of searching for specific services, users simply specify the desired service type, number of people, preferred dates, and price range. Leveraging this information, BookMyLuck randomly allocates bookings among the available offers from registered establishments. This innovative approach adds an element of surprise to the booking process, allowing users to discover new experiences tailored to their preferences without the hassle of decision-making.
